# jFaces - What is that?

jFaces is simple Fisherfaces algorithm in Java. This is a re-written project from pure MATLAB code to Java code. The pourpose with this project is to offer a simple setup of an algorithm that can do image classification.
Fisherfaces is the best algorithm to use if you have a smal amout of data, as 10 pictures of 10 people where the pictrures have not the best resolution. 
You don't need pictures, you can use normal data as well. 

# What should I use jFaces for?

Assume that you want you are creating a web application that going to train a lot of data. But training a lot of data takes time.
You need a faster tool that requries less tuning. 

# How do I use this software?

- Comming soon

# Development - What do I need?

To run work on this project, you need the following software:

- Maven
- OpenJDK 11
- Eclipse IDE

Don't forget to use low quality pictures like Yale database or Jaffed database. jFaces works great with them.

# Where is the orginal source and validation?

Here you can find a fully working report/sample where I have used ByteFish's image classification library. I have tried it out onto some few databases.
It works great!
